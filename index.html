        <h2>Smooth, creamy parmesan béchamel sauce, a slow simmered Bolognese meat sauce, sheets of pasta, and lots of mozzarella cheese make this the World’s Best Lasagna recipe.</h2>
        <p>This traditional Lasagna, from Northern Italy’s Emilia-Romagna region, uses an easy béchamel sauce instead of ricotta cheese. Béchamel is a creamy, silky smooth white sauce made by whisking hot milk into a roux made of flour and butter.</p>
        <p>Parmesan is whisked into the sauce giving it extra flavor which technically makes it a mornay, or cheese sauce. It’s a fancy name, but don’t worry, it’s quick and simple to make.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 lbs Ground beef</li>
            <li>1 Basil, Fresh</li>
            <li>1 Bay leaf</li>
            <li>1 Carrot</li>
            <li>1 Celery stalk</li>
            <li>3 Garlic cloves</li>
            <li>1 Onion</li>
            <li>1 28 oz can Tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 Bouillon cube</li>
            <li>1 Pasta sheets to make 3 layers, Fresh</li>
            <li>1/4 cup All-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1 pinch Nutmeg</li>
            <li>2 Salt and pepper</li>
            <li>1 tsp Sugar</li>
            <li>2 tbsp Olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tsp Vinegar, red</li>
            <li>6 tbsp Butter</li>
            <li>3 1/2 cups Milk</li>
            <li>16 oz Mozzarella cheese, fresh</li>
            <li>1 cup Parmesan</li>
            <li>1 cup Whole milk</li>                
            <li>1/2 cup Water</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>MAKE THE BOLOGNESE SAUCE</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Chop the onion, carrot, and celery very fine. If it’s too big, it might not get soft enough in the sauce. I like to chop mine up in the food processor.</li>
            <li>Sauté the chopped onion, carrot, and celery in butter and olive oil until it is soft and golden. Add the garlic and sauté another minute.</li>
            <li>Add the ground beef and cook until brown, breaking it up into small pieces, and all of the liquid is absorbed.</li>
            <li>Pour in a cup of milk and let simmer until the liquid is absorbed. (If I’m in a hurry, I skip this step, but it does mellow the flavor and add a silky texture to the sauce.)</li>                <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, Italian seasoning, bouillon cube, salt, pepper, sugar, and vinegar. Bring to a simmer. If I’m in a hurry, I allow it to simmer for about 30 minutes, however a long, slow 3 hour simmer is best if you have the time.</li>
            <li>When the sauce is finished, it should be thick as shown here. If it has too much liquid, it will be messy when cut.
            <li>I like to stir in some chopped fresh basil when it’s done. This lightly dried basil from Walmart is pretty cool when it’s hard to get a hold of fresh basil. It stays fresh for 4 weeks after opening.</li>

        </ol>
        <p>MAKE THE BECHAMEL SAUCE</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Whisk in the flour until a smooth roux forms. Let cook about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Whisk in hot milk, and stir until the sauce thickens and can coat the back of a spoon.</li>
            <li>Take off the heat and whisk in parmesan until melted. Cover and set aside. If a skin forms on top, just stir it in before using, it will dissolve.</li>
            <li>Add a pinch of nutmeg. Salt and pepper to taste.</li>

        </ol>
        <p>SOAK THE DRIED LASAGNA NOODLES</p>
        <p>There’s no need to boil dried lasagna noodles. If you’re using dried lasagna noodles, thirty minutes before assembling the lasagna, soak the noodles in hot tap water. Don’t let them soak longer than 30 minutes or they will become too soft, then become mushy in the baked lasagna.</p>
        <p>HOW TO LAYER LASAGNA</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Spread ¼ of the ragù sauce, about 2 cups, onto the bottom of a 9 by 13 inch baking dish.</li>
            <img src="./recipes/layer1.jpg">
            <li>Top with a layer of lasagna noodles or fresh pasta sheets.</li>
            <img src="./recipes/layer2.jpg">
            <li>Spread on ¼ of the ragù sauce, about 2 cups.</li>
            <img src="./recipes/layer3.jpg">
            <li>Spread on 1/3 of the béchamel sauce, about 1 1/3 cups.</li>
            <img src="./recipes/layer4.jpg">
            <li>Sprinkle with 1/3 of the mozzarella, about 1 1/3 cups.</li>
            <img src="./recipes/layer5.jpg">
        </ol>
            <p>Make 2 more layers:</p>
        <ol> 
            <li>noodles, ¼ ragù, 1/3  béchamel, 1/3 mozzarella</li>
            <li>noodles, ¼ ragù, 1/3  béchamel, 1/3 mozzarella</li>

        </ol>
        <p>HOW TO PREVENT THE LASAGNA FROM STICKING TO THE FOIL</p>
        <p>If your Lasagna layers go up to the top of the pan, put in some sticks near the 4 corners of the dish. I use chopsticks that are broken in half. This will prevent the foil from touching the top layer of cheese.</p>
        <p>Cover the Lasagna with foil that has been sprayed with nonstick baking spray.</p>
        <img src="./recipes/chopsticks.jpg">
        <p>HOW LONG TO BAKE LASAGNA</p>
        <p>Cover the Lasagna with foil and bake for 20 minutes in a 375 F oven. After 20 minutes, remove the foil (and the sticks if using) and continue to bake for another 30 minutes until bubbly and the cheese on top starts to get brown spots. You can turn on the broiler for the last minute or two to get the browning you desire. Keep a close eye on it though!</p>
